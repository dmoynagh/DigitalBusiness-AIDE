# AIDE Scope — Standard

> **Identity:** `AIDE_Scope@v2`
> **Common name:** Scope
> **Version 2** (2026-09-01). Requires current AIDE_Tags state before relying on Machine Scope while preserving the two-layer applicability model.

---

## Purpose

Define whether a Standard, Tool, rule, behaviour, or other referenceable capability applies in
the current context.

## Declaration

```yaml
Scope:
  Machine: design & !archived
  Context: >
    Apply when the work could affect governed documentation behaviour.
```

Either `Machine` or `Context` may be omitted.

To make an item explicitly non-applicable:

```yaml
Scope:
  Disabled: true
```

## Semantics

- Missing Machine Scope means no machine restriction.
- Missing Context Scope means no contextual restriction.
- If both are present, both must pass.
- If neither is present, the item is generally applicable.
- `Disabled: true` always returns not applicable.

## Evaluation

1. If disabled, return false.
2. If Machine Scope exists, evaluate it using `AIDE_Tags`; if false, return false.
3. If Context Scope exists, evaluate its natural-language condition against the current context;
   if false, return false.
4. Otherwise return true.

Scope returns applicability only. It does not execute the scoped behaviour.

## Machine Scope

Machine Scope is an `AIDE_Tags` Boolean query. Do not add a separate Scope expression language.

## Tag freshness

Machine Scope is deterministic only over current `AIDE_Tags` state. If generated-tag freshness is
uncertain, rerun the applicable Tag Builders under `AIDE_Tags` before relying on the Machine result.
Scope consumes that freshness rule; it does not own another regeneration mechanism.

## Context Scope

Context Scope is descriptive applicability interpreted by the AI. Use it for semantic or
judgment-based conditions that would make the machine expression unnecessarily complex.

## Platform realisation

Concrete discovery and trigger mechanisms are platform Build concerns. Platform builders may use
Scope declarations to create effective target-platform metadata, but this Standard does not
define plugin, skill, repository, bundle, or platform-specific trigger mechanics.
