# AIDE Tags — Standard

> **Identity:** `AIDE_Tags@v3`
> **Common name:** Tags
> **Version 3** (2026-09-03). Defines snapshot-relative freshness for immutable built/deployed artefacts.

---

## Purpose

Provide a small, extensible tag system that lets Standards define Tag Builders, maintain derived
classification data on artefacts, and evaluate simple deterministic tag expressions.

## Tag Builder definition

A Standard may contribute a Tag Builder by embedding an `AIDE_TagBuilder` YAML block.

A builder must define:

- `Id` — unique builder identity in the available Standards set;
- `Owner` — semantic owner;
- `AppliesWhen` — how the builder decides whether it applies to the artefact in hand;
- `Source` — how it locates/reads its source information;
- `Generate` — how it derives the current tag values;
- `OutputOwnership` — exactly one owned `Prefix` or owned `Group` key.

Example:

```yaml
AIDE_TagBuilder:
  Id: DocType
  Owner: AIDE_DocumentationMethodology
  AppliesWhen:
    Description: Run when canonical DocType metadata is present.
  Source:
    Description: Read DocType and InheritedDocTypes as defined by DocMeth.
  Generate:
    Description: Generate one tag for each current value.
  OutputOwnership:
    Prefix: "doctype-"
```

## Build behaviour

A Tags build pass:

1. discovers all available `AIDE_TagBuilder` definitions;
2. gives each builder the artefact in hand;
3. lets the builder determine applicability;
4. lets an applicable builder generate its current tags and remove stale tags it owns;
5. leaves manual tags and other builders' output unchanged.

Builders must be idempotent. If a builder applies but cannot complete correctly, it reports the
failure visibly and does not silently leave misleading partial output.

## Ownership

A builder identifies generated tags by either:

- an owned tag prefix; or
- an owned group `{key}:[...]`.

The builder owns generation and cleanup only inside that boundary.

Groups are invisible to every consumer except their owning builder. All other consumers see only
the contained tag values.

## Storage

For a governed Markdown document, store tags as one compact footer metadata property:

```text
Tags: tag-a, tag_b, group:[tag-c, tag_d]
```

The metadata container and placement are supplied by the governing document methodology; this
Standard owns only the `Tags:` content contract.

Tag values contain no whitespace. Use `-` or `_` as separators. Manual and generated tags may
coexist.

## Query

Before matching, flatten groups to their contained tag values and ignore group keys.

Supported operators:

```text
!   NOT
&   AND
|   OR
()  grouping
```

Precedence: `!`, then `&`, then `|`.

Matching uses exact tag values. Extra tags do not affect a query unless named by it. Wildcards,
inference, inheritance traversal, comparisons, and functions are not part of the query language.

## Freshness

When source information capable of changing generated tags changes, run applicable Tag Builders
before the artefact is published/saved as current where those tags form part of governed state.
Before tag-dependent behaviour relies on generated tags whose freshness is uncertain, rerun the
applicable builders first. An explicit rebuild may be used at any time.

For an immutable Build package/output, run or validate applicable builders against the exact
authoritative source snapshot before freeze and preserve compact freshness/source-snapshot evidence.
The resulting tags remain current for that immutable snapshot. Registry, Deployment and runtime
consumers use those frozen tags; they do not rerun producer-owned builders merely because newer
upstream source now exists. Newer source requiring different tags makes the producer/build/deployed
state behind current source and requires a new producer update/build path.

Tags owns this freshness rule but does not provide runtime polling or a generic orchestration
engine. The changing/publishing/relying operation invokes the builders and supplies current source
state; builders do not reconstruct semantic inheritance or upstream state themselves.
