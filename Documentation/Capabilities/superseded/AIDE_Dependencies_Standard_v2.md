# AIDE Dependencies — Standard

> **Identity:** `AIDE_Dependencies@v2`
> **Common name:** Dependencies
> **Version 2** (2026-08-29). Adds significant declaration-order/default processing precedence and
> aligns saved conformance advancement with `AIDE_Migration@v1`.

---

## Purpose

Declare what an artefact relies on; resolve dependency identity; report presence/version state; and
preserve the last saved, proven conformance checkpoint.

## Storage

```text
Dependencies: abc, !def@v4, !!ghi@!v7, owner:[jkl@v2, !mno]
```

The governing document methodology supplies the metadata container. This Standard owns the
`Dependencies:` content contract.

## Presence and version grammar

```text
dependency      normal relationship
!dependency     required on relevant use/access
!!dependency    best-effort startup presence check + required thereafter
dependency@vN   last saved/proven conformance checkpoint
dependency@!vN  exact available version vN required
```

Markers compose.

Resolve identity name first, ignoring version; compare version after resolution. Multiple matches
fail visibly.

## Declaration order

Dependency order is significant. Earlier entries have higher **default processing precedence**
when an operation needs deterministic ordering, unless an explicit relationship or governing
operation supplies another order.

This is processing/foundational precedence, not requirement severity.

## Dependency Query

Return at least resolution, requirement level, conformance version, available version, version
relation/gap, exact-version result, and effective declaration order where needed.

Dependencies reports facts. Migration/current operations decide the consequence.

## Conformance checkpoint

A recorded version advances only when the dependent artefact is updated/saved in a state proven
through that version.

- availability alone never advances it;
- `None`/`NotApplicable` migration versions may count as traversed but are persisted only on the
  next artefact save;
- failed/deferred migration does not advance through the unresolved version;
- partial success advances only through the last saved proven version.

## Exact-version constraints

`abc@!v8` requires exactly v8 to be available. Dependencies reports whether the constraint passes.
The governing dependent Standard/document context defines how that constraint should be handled by
Migration or the current operation.

## Required/startup-required

`!` is checked on relevant use/access and missing identity is surfaced prominently.

`!!` additionally requests a best-effort startup **presence** check through the Core bootstrap
mechanism. It does not imply a general startup Migration scan.

## Dependency Builder

Standards may contribute `AIDE_DependencyBuilder` definitions. Builders own only their generated
Group/Prefix output, preserve meaningful order, are idempotent, and fail visibly when applicable
output cannot be derived correctly. Group keys remain invisible to non-owning consumers.
