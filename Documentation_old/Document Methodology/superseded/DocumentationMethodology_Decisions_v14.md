## D1 — Metadata containers are generic hosts

**Decision.** DocMeth owns placement/coexistence/compact rendering for header metadata, temporary
state and footer metadata. Contributing owners retain semantics.

## D2 — Documentation Methodology conformance is a Dependency

**Decision.** Retire the special `Methodology: vN` footer from v18. A document records its
saved/proven DocMeth conformance through `AIDE_Dependencies`.

**Reason.** This removes a duplicate version-gap/checkpoint mechanism and lets Migration govern
Required/OnUpdate/None transitions consistently.

## D3 — v18 migration posture is OnUpdate

**Decision.** v18 is `OnUpdate`.

**Reason.** v17 documents remain safely readable. The metadata/conformance model should be applied
when a document is next changed rather than forcing a corpus-wide rewrite merely to refresh
metadata. An operation that explicitly requires v18-only semantics can require migration first.

## D4 — Tags and Dependencies are hosted, not redefined

**Decision.** `Tags:` and `Dependencies:` are footer properties hosted by DocMeth. Their internal
grammar/build/query/conformance semantics remain with `AIDE_Tags` and `AIDE_Dependencies`.

## D5 — Identity is header metadata

**Decision.** Formal Core `Identity:` metadata is hosted in the header container where a governed
document exposes a referenceable identity. Filename and formal identity remain distinct.

## D6 — Temporary state is compact and owner-labelled

**Decision.** An optional temporary state container is placed near the top of the document.
Entries require stable owner identity plus concise human-readable title/message. The owner alone
defines lifecycle/content.

## D7 — WorkPackage execution semantics move to Build

**Decision.** DocMeth retains WorkPackage/Outcome document naming and archive integration but
delegates generic WorkPackage contract/execution/validation/return semantics to
`AIDE_WorkPackage@v1` and `AIDE_Build@v1`.

## D8 — Machine content remains compact

**Decision.** Metadata, derived state and generated operational content should be as compact as
practicable in human-readable documents.
